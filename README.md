# Gaussian Naive Bayes Algorithm in Python

This repository contains an implementation of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm in Python. Gaussian Naive Bayes is a popular classification algorithm that is particularly well-suited for data with continuous features. It's based on the Bayesian probability theorem and assumes that features are normally distributed within each class.


## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the code:

- `pandas`
- `math`
- `numpy`
- `decimal`
- `statistics`

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy statistics pandas python-math pypi-cdecimal 
```
## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/KevinInkjet/Gaussian-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-in-Python.git
```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder:

```
cd Gaussian-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm-in-Python
```

3. Run the `bayes.py` script:

```
python bayes.py
```
